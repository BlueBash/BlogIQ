üîç Step 1: Topic and Keyword Selection:

At its core, BlogIQ simplifies content creation by allowing users to specify their desired topic and primary keyword. Leveraging data from the dataforseo.com API, the app conducts an extensive Google search to curate a selection of relevant URLs.

üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Title and Structure Generation:

Powered by Langchain, Langgraph, and OpenAI GPT-4 models, BlogIQ facilitates title and structure generation with unprecedented accuracy. Users are presented with a range of options tailored to their preferences, with the added flexibility of providing input to direct the GPT-4 models during this process, ensuring that the generated content seamlessly aligns with their vision and objectives. üí≠‚ú®

üìù Step 3: Content Generation:

Expanding upon the chosen structure, BlogIQ dynamically generates content enriched with insights gleaned from the selected URLs and meta keywords. Users can further guide the content generation process by providing prompts to the GPT-4 models, fostering personalized and engaging content creation experiences. üìù‚ú®

üí¨ Step 4: FAQ Generation:

In the final stage, BlogIQ completes the content creation journey by generating FAQs for the blog. By analyzing the generated content and identifying potential questions, the app automatically generates a set of FAQs, enriching the blog post with valuable additional information and enhancing its engagement potential. ü§îüí¨
